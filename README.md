# Adventure-Game -part of Udcty course project
In this project, I have to make a simpler version of an old fashioned text-based adventure game. As you can see, this is only a very
short game with a couple of choices available to the player. I did that on purpose, to keep it simple. For this projec, the idea is to 
focus on some key things.
  - The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
  - Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
  - The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
  - The game has conditions for winning and losing.
  - When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
  
  This prroject met all critera listed.
    - Output text to the console.
    - Import modules and use functions from those modules.
    - Use the input function in combination with conditional statements (e.g., if and while) to create an interactive program.
    - Use a conditional loop to handle invalid input.
    - Refactor code by defining and calling functions.
        The code includes at least four function definitions that are used to improve the code in some way, such as by:
          -Reducing repetition
          -Reducing complexity
          -Improving the readability or organization of the code
          -Each function should have a single purpose and a name that describes that purpose.
    - Write code that follows the standard Python style guide.
      - The pycodestyle tool reports zero errors and zero warnings.
    - Test code and produce an error-free program.
